# Logic-and-Recursion-Theory
This repo is a share space for scratching some workout in mathematical logic (a.k.a. compiler design) and recursion theory (a.k.a. computability theory or Turing machine)

## What I have done right now.
- Propositional Logic

## What the other lessons I still miss.
- First-order logic
- Recursion theory (first week)
